Open Shooter
=======================

Origin
------

The majoirty of consumer automated tennis ball shooters are unnecessarily expensive, while typically being quite primitive. The cheapest iFetch for smaller to medium sized dogs costs $130, and only contains a single cheap loud motor and 3 LEDs. The unit has to either be plugged in constantly or the consumer has to waste 6 C batteries for it to be wireless. Somehow, they managed to make tennis balls a properitary technology, as this model uses an uncommon tiny ball size of 1.5 inches. Which you'll likely have to purchase directly from them, as the smallest sized ball at most stores is 2.0 inches. To add insult to, literal, injury, the device only provides 3 launch speeds, with the lowest setting still being far too fast for initial training with smaller dogs. This isn't a hypothetical concern, several customers returned the product after it injured their pet, with them leaving, deservingly, bad [reviews](https://www.chewy.com/ifetch-mini-automatic-ball-launcher/dp/142434?utm_source=google-product&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=iFetch&utm_campaign=19996370614&utm_term=&gad_source=1). Imagine learning to play basketball for the first time, but whenever you made a shot, there was a chance a random person on the sideline would hurl a 30mph basketball directly at your face.

There is no reason for a simple product like this to endager the animal they are designed for.
