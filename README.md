Which you'll likely have to purchase directly from them, as the smallest sized ball at most stores is 2.0 inches. To add insult to, literal, injury, the device only provides 3 launch speeds, with the lowest setting still being far too fast for initial training with smaller dogs.

Imagine learning to play basketball for the first time, but whenever you made a shot, there was a chance a random person on the sideline would hurl a 30mph basketball directly at your face.
